#Part 2: Written Questions


Question 2.1: Explain your decisions
Why did you structure your code the way you did?

I structured my code into several small modules which not only allows me to have clearer code but also allows me to be able to reuse my code if necessary

What would you do differently in a production environment?

In production I will take the time to write unit tests and above all I will not leave the .env file online in the git repository as I did with this test. 
I left it just so you have access to the mongo database I created for this exam

Question 2.2: Code Review
In my opinion the code has no errors but requires a lot of improvement such as the validation of the 
data received because the user can for example enter a  string in the age field.
It is also important to use exception handlers to prevent the server from crashing in the 
event of incorrect handling and for greater clarity we could separate the function from the app.use instruction.

Part 3: Time Management Task

for this case we will consider that I have one week to resolve the stains
I will start with task number one because it seems to me to be the most important. 
If after a day I do not have a favorable solution I will refer to my superior or a member of the team to ask for help and 
I will I'm going to continue with task 3 just after because it will allow others to progress on their work as they will certainly need the API in 
their work so I'm going to do the documentation and half a day or less will be enough so that's it. is cheap to pay in terms of time.
after this I will go directly to the module requested by the client which should take me 2 or 3 days 
depending on the complexity of the module and I will finish by optimizing the database so that I can use 
my weekend on it if I didn't finish it during the week knowing that it's a task that has a lot less pressure than the others.
